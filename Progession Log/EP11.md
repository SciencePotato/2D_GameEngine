## [Batch Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDh80Hmv7jM&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE&index=12)
Solves the issues of having different VAO for different sprite and shapes. In 2D games,
you'll know that everything is simple. Using this, we batch it (Make one giant batch that's interconnected); otherwise
normally you have to render everything individually (Iteration).

### Structure
This episode, Conceptually is easy to understand, the code is less so. It basically abstracts
the update method completed in "LevelEditorScene" and changed it into a huge process.

**LOGIC BEHIND IT**  
GameObject creation ->  
Renderer (Multiple Batches) ->  
Each Batch have x amount of objects that require rendering.

### Renderer
```java
public class Renderer {
    private final int MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 1000;
    private List<RenderBatch> batches;

    public Renderer() {
        this.batches = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void add(GameObject go) {
        SpriteRenderer spr = go.getComponent(SpriteRenderer.class);
        if (spr != null) {
            add(spr);
        }
    }

    private void add(SpriteRenderer sprite) {
        boolean added = false;
        for (RenderBatch batch : batches) {
            if (batch.hasRoom()) {
                batch.addSprite(sprite);
                added = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!added) {
            RenderBatch newBatch = new RenderBatch(MAX_BATCH_SIZE);
            newBatch.start();
            batches.add(newBatch);
            newBatch.addSprite(sprite);
        }

    }

    public void render()    {
        for (RenderBatch batch : batches) {
            batch.render();
        }
    }
}
```
The renderer basically creates and add gameObject to batches if need be, so instead of
rendering 1000 gameObject individually, you can have however many batches and from there you can
render it batches by batches.
