# 2D_GameEngine

## About The Project
As a beginner, learning computer graphics is extremely diffcult. This is my progress of learning Computer Graphics/Game Engine,
following the tutorial by [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQP4qSCj1eHMHisDDR4iPzw). It was entirely 
created following his tutorial [Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UYxTtJQuuw&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE&index=2).

Resources that were extremely Helpful throughout the creation of this project besides [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQP4qSCj1eHMHisDDR4iPzw)
- [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThinMatrix)
- [The Book of Shader](https://thebookofshaders.com/)
- 

## End Goal
Hopefully, after the completion of this project, I will understand how to create a game engine, or render graphics using OpenGL 
in Java; and hopefully transfer the skillset to C++. Besides this, just a general understanding of how a game Engine works, and
eventually implement a game engine.
